## Structure of the project 
Three models were tested during the projects, but only two gave satisfactory results.
* GPT (most successful results) ==> [notebook_name]
* LSTM model with attention layers ==> [notebook_name]

Both workflows are integrated in the notebooks. Beware that the training part can take a long time (30 mn to several hours depending on computation power). 
Other directoriess include : 
* package for preprocessing and training part of the GPT model ==> 'https://github.com/aeraymd/chopin_28_prelude/tree/master/music21-LSTM-model'
* subfolders for exploratory work
